abstract = {A number of topics that involve the selection and performance of propellers are presented in the chapter. These range from fundamentals of propeller installation and regulatory aspects, to design and thrust generation. A section is dedicated to discussing a number of peculiar effects the propeller has on the aircraft and the aircraft designer must be aware of. Generally referred to as the P-factor, these effects include gyroscopic precession, normal and yaw force, angular momentum, as well as asymmetric thrust effects for multi-engine aircraft and AÂ·q loads for turboprops. This is followed by a number of tips to help the designer select the right propeller, ranging from initial estimation of suitable diameter and pitch, to basics of thrust and power related coefficients, to methods helpful when selecting the number of blades. Then several procedures to estimate propeller thrust are presented. These include methods developed based on industry experience, as well as standard methods, such as the Rankine-Froude Momentum and Blade Element theories. These can be used to estimate thrust, induced airspeed in the streamtube going through the propeller, propeller efficiency, and power required to rotate the propeller.}
